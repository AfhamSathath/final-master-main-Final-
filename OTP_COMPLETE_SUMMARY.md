## 🎯 What You Get

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- ✅ **OTP Model** - `server/models/OTP.js`
- ✅ **3 API Endpoints** with proper validation:
  - `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Generate & send OTP via email
  - `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` - Validate OTP code
  - `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Update password
- ✅ **Nodemailer Integration** - Gmail SMTP with 2FA support
- ✅ **Email Template** - Professional HTML email with OTP

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- ✅ **3 Complete Pages**:
  - ForgetPassword.tsx - Request OTP
  - VerifyOtp.tsx - Enter OTP
  - ResetPassword.tsx - Create new password (with strength validation)
- ✅ **Routing Setup** - All routes configured in App.tsx
- ✅ **Environment Config** - VITE_API_URL already set
